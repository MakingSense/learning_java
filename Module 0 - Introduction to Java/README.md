# introduction to Java

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

This is generally referred as JVM. Before, we discuss about JVM lets see the phases of program execution. Phases are as follows: we write the program, then we compile the program and at last we run the program.
1. Writing of the program is of course done by java programmer like you and me.
2. Compilation of program is done by javac compiler, javac is the primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes java program as input and generates java bytecode as output.
3. In third phase, JVM executes the bytecode generated by compiler. This is called program run phase.

### bytecode
As discussed above, javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. The bytecode is saved in a .class file by compiler.

### Java Development Kit(JDK)
While explaining JVM and bytecode, I have used the term JDK. Let’s discuss about it. As the name suggests this is complete java development kit that includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various tools like JavaDoc, Java debugger etc.
In order to create, compile and run Java program you would need JDK installed on your computer.

### Java Runtime Environment(JRE)
JRE is a part of JDK which means that JDK includes JRE. When you have JRE installed on your system, you can run a java program however you won’t be able to compile it. 
JRE includes JVM, browser plugins and applets support. When you only need to run a java program on your computer, you would only need JRE.

## Java: The Main features

* Java is a platform independent language
* Java is an Object Oriented language
* Simple
* Robust Language
* Secure
* Java is distributed
* Multithreading
* Portable

## JVM Vs JRE Vs JDK
JRE: JRE is the environment within which the java virtual machine runs. JRE contains Java virtual Machine(JVM), class libraries, and other files excluding development tools such as compiler and debugger.
Which means you can run the code in JRE but you can’t develop and compile the code in JRE.

JVM: As we discussed above, JVM runs the program by using class, libraries and files provided by JRE.

JDK: JDK is a superset of JRE, it contains everything that JRE has along with development tools such as compiler, debugger etc.
